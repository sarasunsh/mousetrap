# MouseTrap

## Science is hard. MouseTrap wants to make it easier.

Researchers at academic laboratories and biotech companies are working tirelessly to identify and test new drugs to benefit human patients. A critical part of the drug development process is conducting large complex animal studies, but there is a dearth of adequate technological tools for organizing these studies.  MouseTrap is a single page application (SPA) that allows scientists to design experiments, manage their mouse colonies, track study progress, and conduct ad hoc analyses such as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. MouseTrap also allows collaborators at separate facilities to communicate in real time via chat. 

To get started with MouseTrap, simply clone or download this repository. Then `npm install` and `npm start`.

Technologies: React-Redux on the front-end with url route handling via React-Router and API route handling with Express. On the back-end, the database runs on a PostgreSQL/Sequelize.
